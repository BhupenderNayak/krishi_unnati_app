## ðŸ”§ How to Run the App

### Prerequisites
* Flutter SDK
* Python 3.x
* Google Chrome Browser (Updated)

### 1. Backend Setup (Python APIs)

The app requires two separate Python Flask servers.

1.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * Open a terminal in the project's root folder.
    * Run: `venv\Scripts\activate`

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    * (Make sure you are inside the activated `venv`)
    * Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3.  **Start the Servers:**
    * Open **two separate terminals**, and activate the `venv` in both.
    * **Terminal 1 (Price API):**
        ```bash
        python price_api.py
        ```
        *(This will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`)*
    * **Terminal 2 (Chat API):**
        ```bash
        python chat_api.py
        ```
        *(This will run on `http://0.0.0.0:5001`)*

### 2. Frontend Setup (Flutter App)

1.  **Install Flutter Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

2.  **Configure API Host IP (CRUCIAL for Real Device):**
    * Open `lib/services/api_service.dart`.
    * Find the `_priceApiBaseUrl` and `_chatApiBaseUrl` variables.
    * Replace the IP address with your computer's actual Wi-Fi IP address.
        * To find your IP: Open Command Prompt and type `ipconfig`. Look for "IPv4 Address".
    * **Example:**
    * Note i made some comments in the file from where you can put your ip address
        ```dart
        
        final String _priceApiBaseUrl = '[http://192.168.1.5:5000](http://192.168.1.5:5000)'; // YOUR IP
        final String _chatApiBaseUrl = '[http://192.168.1.5:5001](http://192.168.1.5:5001)';   // YOUR IP
        ```

3.  **Run the Flutter App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    * Make sure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
    * Ensure your **Windows Firewall** allows Python to communicate on ports 5000 and 5001.
